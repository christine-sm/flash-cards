### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: **Exceeds Expectations**

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

***I think your user stories are awesome! Additionally, I love how you included a whole section about unsolved problems and pseudocode. It was really great to read and see more of your thought process and challenges.***


* __Technical Requirements__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

***Great job on your first project! Your flash cards game is not only functional, but very creative and the interface is great. Also, great job using a constructor function :)***


* __Code Quality__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

***Good job implementing OOP components in your project! I think some of your errors might be more easily identified by abstracting and breaking down some of your methods into smaller functions/objects as well as cleaning up some of the unused commented-out code. Additionally, just watch out for global variables***


* __Problem Solving__: Meets Expectations

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

***You did a great job working through your problems, especially working around errors!***
